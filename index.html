      <h2 id="SC_API">SoundCloud API</h2>
      <p>Using the SoundCloud API, you can build applications that take sound on the web to the next level. With this guide we explain and provide code examples for many common integration use cases like playing and uploading sounds or how to take advantage of SoundCloud's many social features. If you're looking for more in depth information, feel free to jump to our API Reference.<br>
         To help you get started quickly, SDKs are available for Python, Ruby, JavaScript. To follow along with the examples below, you'll need to have at least one SDK installed.<br>
        Now go ahead and jump to the section you're most interested in and get started.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section">
      <h2 id="SDK">SoundCloud SDK</h2>
      <p>The SDKs will make it easier to access the SoundCloud API on your framework of choice. We officially provide and support Ruby, Python and JavaScript. All other SDKs are supported by third-party developers.<br>
        We welcome contributions to the open source projects so imagine how happy we'd be if you submit an SDK of your own for any additional language.</p>

      <p>In order to access the JavaScript object which provides the SoundCloud Widget API, add this script to your html page.<br>  
         This script exposes the SC.Widget(/*iframeElement|iframeElementID*/) function to the global scope. It allows you to control the widget from the parent page (the page the widget is inserted into). SC.Widget accepts the reference to the iframe element or its id.</p>

        <p><b>Buttons & Logos - How to Properly Attribute in Your App</b></p>
        <p>It's always nice to give people credit for their work. If you're building an app that uses data provided by SoundCloud and our community it's best to give attribution. It's a way of saying thanks and encourages people to keep creating awesome things.</p>
        <p>When using someone's work, give them similar representation and link back to where the creator and original work can be found.<br>
        In some rare use cases it's tricky to attribute exactly in this way. For those cases we ask that you:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Credit the uploader as the creator of the sound</li>
          <li>Credit SoundCloud as the source by including one of the logos below</li>
          <li>Link to the SoundCloud URL containing the work</li>
        </ol>
